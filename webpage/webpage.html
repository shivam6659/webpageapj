<p><h3>

Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam was born to a poor Tamil Muslim family. He lived with his family in the temple city of Tamilnadu, Rameswaram, where his father,
 Jainulabdeen, had a boat and was an imam of a local mosque. At the same time, his mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife. Kalam had four brothers and one sister
 in his family, from which he was the youngest. Kalam's ancestors were wealthy traders and landowners and had vast land and property tracts. But with time, 
their business of ferrying pilgrims and trading groceries suffered huge losses due to the Pamban Bridge's opening. As a result, Kalam's family had become inadequate.
 and struggled hard to make a living. At a tender age, Kalam had to sell newspapers to supplement his family income.

Although Kalam had average grades in school, he was very hard working and had an immense desire to learn. He spent a lot of time studying 
and had developed a particular interest in mathematics. Kalam left Schwartz higher secondary school after completing his early education and 
went to Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirapalli. From Saint Joseph's College, he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study 
aerospace engineering at Madras Institute of Technology.

<h3>

Kalam joined as a scientist in the aeronautical development establishment of DRDO in 1960, after graduation. His career started with him designing a small
 hovercraft. However, he was not convinced by his choice of a job at the DRDO. Kalam was transferred to ISRO in 1969, where he was the project director of 
India's first satellite vehicle launch. The satellite vehicle deployed the Rohini satellite successfully in near-Earth orbit in July 1980. Kalam received 
the Government's LV and Slv projects between the 1970s-90s. He directed two projects like Project Devil and Project Valiant, which aimed at developing ballistic 
missiles from the successful SLV program's technology Kalam somehow convinced Indira Gandhi and sought secret funds for these aerospace projects. His research and 
immense knowledge brought him and the nation great laurels in the 1980s.

Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party 
and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6] he returned to his 
civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, 
including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.
While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015,
 aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state 
honours.[8]

Sir Kalam was entitled to be the 11th president of India. His term period of 25th July 2002 to 25th July 2007 was achieved by winning a presidential election in 
2002 with a massive margin of votes. National Democratic Alliances’ nominated him to be president and it was supported by Samajwadi Party and National Congress Party.
He was lovingly called as peoples’ president as he had done uncountable works for the welfare of the people and through the entire country.
or sensitive or highly controversial. The “office of profit” is perhaps the hard Act that he had to sign. The “office of profit”, according to the English Act of 
Settlement in 1701 explains that no single individual who has a professional set up under the royal family, who has some kind of provision with or who is taking a 
pension from the prince has the right to work for the of the “House of Commons”. This will allow the royal family to have zero influence on the administrative 
conditions.

This complex persona was a notable researcher displaying huge and unending science and mechanical innovative work. It was he who made our country atomic in its
 most genuine sense. It was in the year 1974, under the oversight of Dr. Kalam, that India went through its most memorable atomic test. Next came the Pokhran - II in 
the year 1988. It was through these atomic tests Dr. Kalam showed the world India's situation and power in atomic innovation.His works granted him three great 
honours from the Govt. of India specifically Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan, and the Bharat Ratna. In the year 1997, Kalam was likewise granted the Indira Gandhi 
Award for National Integration. He was granted the Veer Savarkar Award in the year 1980 and the Ramanujan Award in the year 2000. From 40 colleges all over the world, 
Kalam got privileged doctorates.He was the writer of various motivational books like "India 2010", "Touched off Minds", "Mission India", "The Luminous Sparks", "Wings 
of Fire", and "Moving Thoughts".His life, work, and convictions are loaded up with models and motivations. He will keep on inspiring us for eternity. Furthermore, this is the genuine justification
 for why individuals from every one of the segments of the general public precipitously show love for this incredible person on his miserable end at IIM Shillong on 
27th July 2015.May this Noble and faithful Soul find happiness in the hereafter.
